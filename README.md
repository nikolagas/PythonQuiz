# PythonQuiz
A small command-line 10-20 question science quiz I built in my spare time

Requirements were:

1. Ask the user their name;
2. Runs through all questions of the quiz and keep a running score of the number of correctly questions answered;
3. The system displays questions in random order each time the quiz is taken;
4. The user is shown which questions they got correct and which they got incorrect 
   (as well as showing the correct answer for any questions they answered incorrectly);
5. Once the user(s) answered all the questions, the system should print out their score out of their chosen quiz length
   as well as a percentage score on the screen;
6. The program should then prompt to ask if anybody else wants to take the quiz. It should then perform steps 1-4 again for the next user;
7. Once all the users have finished the quiz, the program displays:
    7.1 Highest total scores
    7.2 Highest percentage scores
8. Handle user errors (e.g., incorrect input type, such as empty answer or name etc.).
